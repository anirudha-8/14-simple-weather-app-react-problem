Welcome to the **fourteenth problem** of the React 30+ Practical Problems series! In this challenge, we will develop a weather application that fetches and displays real-time weather information based on the user's location.

### Problem 14: Weather App ⛅🌦️

Build a React application that fetches weather data based on the user's location and displays key weather details.

---

## 📝 Problem Description

Create a React weather application with the following functionalities:

- **Automatically detect the user's location** using the browser's Geolocation API.
- **Fetch weather data** from an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).
- Display **temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition**.
- Handle **loading and error states** effectively.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Submodule Repository:**

    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/anirudha-8/14-simple-weather-app-react-problem.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

    ```bash
        cd 14-simple-weather-app-react-problem
    ```

3. Install Dependencies:

    ```bash
        npm install
    ```

4. Start the Development Server:

    ```bash
        npm run dev

## 🌐 API Usage

- This app uses **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch weather data.
- You need to sign up for an **API key** at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- Store your API key in an **.env file** like this:

    ```bash
        VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Learn how to use the **Geolocation API** to get the user's location.

- Fetch data from an **external API** using `fetch` or `axios`.

- Manage state effectively with **React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)**.

- Handle **loading and error states** properly in UI.
